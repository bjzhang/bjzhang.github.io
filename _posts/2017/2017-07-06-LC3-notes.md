Join the LC3 China last week. Some topics seem very interesting.

Secure container
----------------
[Secure Containers with EPT Isolation(Huawei, Intel)](https://www.slideshare.net/LCChina/secure-containers-with-ept-isolation) build the containers with EPT page table protection. EPT is a memory virtualization technology used in kvm and xen by default. It could deployed in vm in the cloud compare with the kvm-based ontainers(Intel: Clear Container or [Huawei vm-based containers](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/LinuxCon-VM-based%20container-submission-v4.pdf)).

Chunyan Liu From Huawei show that how to prevent the attack by namespace-alike memory isolation:

nvme performance optimization
-----------------------------
Coly Li from suse work on ssd/nvm optimization. He Explain the bottleneck for the Global I/O barrier and show the performance improvement after Hash Bucket Barriers and Lockless I/O barrier merged[3].

<img alt="nvme_lockless_io_barrier" src="{{site.url}}/public/images/misc/nvme_lockless_io_barrier.jpg" width="100%" align="center" style="margin: 0px 15px">

The final performance comparision are as follows

notes:
*   There is race condition in 4.4. The performance is higher but useless.
*   Hash bucket barrier lead to a little downgrade of performance because more conflict are encountered. After apply the lockless I/O barrier, the performance is a little bit improvement.

libos and unikernel
-------------------
There are two relative topics about libos. The first one from vmware who work on [Linux libos](https://www.slideshare.net/LCChina/unikernelized-linux). It seems similar with [the work from Hajime Tazaki <tazaki@sfc.wide.ad.jp>](https://lwn.net/Articles/637658/). The other one is port unikernel to aarch64 in [uKVM](https://www.slideshare.net/LCChina/64bit-arm-unikernels-on-ukvm). I think unikernel could potentially get performance improvement for single process application if unikernel could provide all the dependency for apps. It seems that the only use-casse is network based application. Compare with unikernel, running a 'full functional' Linux as base of libos seems resolve the port effort for the dependency of apps, because the software on Linux do not need modify(only need to statically linked).
