The ARM architecture has gained support for the "system control and management interface", or SCMI. It is a set of standards for system management and, in particular power management.
```
```
    ARM System Control and Management Interface(SCMI)[1] is more flexible and
    easily extensible than any of the existing interfaces.

    Few existing as well as future ARM platforms provide micro-controllers
    to abstract various power and other system management tasks which have
    similar interfaces, both in terms of the functions that are provided by
    them, and in terms of how requests are communicated to them.

    There are quite a few protocols like ARM SCPI, TI SCI, QCOM RPM, Nvidia Tegra
    BPMP, and so on already. This specification is to standardize and avoid any
    further fragmentation in the design of such interface by various vendors.

    The current SCMI driver implementation is very basic and initial support.
    It lacks support for notifications, asynchronous/delayed response, perf/power
    statistics region and sensor register region.

    Mailbox is the only form of transport supported currently in the driver.
    SCMI supports interrupt based mailbox communication, where, on completion
    of the processing of a message, the caller receives an interrupt as well as
    polling for completion.

    SCMI is designed to minimize the dependency on the mailbox/transport
    hardware. So in terms of SCMI, each channel in the mailbox includes
    memory area, doorbell and completion interrupt.

    However the doorbell and completion interrupt is highly mailbox dependent
    which was bit of controversial as part of SCMI/mailbox discussions.

    Arnd and me discussed about the few aspects of SCMI and the mailbox framework:

    1. Use of mailbox framework for doorbell type mailbox controller:
       - Such hardware may not require any data to be sent to signal the remote
         about the presence of a message. The channel will have in-built
         information on how to trigger the signal to the remote.
         There are few mailbox controller drivers which are purely doorbell based.
         e.g.QCOM IPC, STM, Tegra, ACPI PCC,..etc

    2. Supporting other mailbox controller:
       - SCMI just needs a mechanism to signal the remote firmware. Such
         controller may need fixed message to be sent to trigger a doorbell.
         In such case we may need to get that data from DT and pass the same
         to the controller. It's not covered in the current DT binding, but
         can be extended as optional property in future.

         However handling notifications may be interesting on such mailbox, but
         again there is no way to interpret what the data field(remote message)
         means, it could be a bit mask or a number or don't-care.

    Arnd mentioned that he doesn't like the way the mailbox binding deals
    with doorbell-type hardware, but we do have quite a few precedent drivers
    already and changing the binding to add a data field would not make it any
    better, but could cause other problems. So he is happy with the status quo
    of SCMI implementation.

之前有遇到产品使用MAP_FIXED，但是和系统map冲突，由于没有提示或失败，系统会出奇怪的问题。
```
The mmap() system call supports a new MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE option. Like MAP_FIXED, it tries to place the new memory region at a user-supplied address.  Unlike MAP_FIXED, though, it will not replace an existing mapping at that address; instead, it will fail with EEXIST if such a mapping exists. This is the change that was discussed last year as MAP_FIXED_SAFE; it seems that the battle over the proper name for the feature has finally been resolved.
```

```
The way that system calls are invoked on the x86-64 architecture has been reworked to make it more uniform and flexible. The new scheme has also been designed to prevent unused (but caller-controlled) data from getting onto the call stack — where it could perhaps be used in a speculative-execution attack.
